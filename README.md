# ETH Machine Learning course projects (Autumn 2016)
## Project 1: Predicting a person's age from brain MR images
In this project we apply regression techniques to predict a person's age from a three-dimensional magnetic resonance (MR) image of their brain.

## Project 2: Classifying brain health status from MR images
In this project we classify a person's cognitive health status only from an MR scan of their brain.

## Project 3: Multi-Label Classification of Brain MR images
In this project, we simultaneously classify a person's gender, age and cognitive health status based on an MR image of their brain.
